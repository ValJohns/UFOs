## Overview of Analysis: 
### I was approached a professional journalist named Dana, who requested to my assistance to prepare a visualization regarding UFO data she had compiled. Dana's perference was a webpage that would be accessible worldwide. I needed to produce a filter on the webpage due to mass amount of data that was presented.


## DIRECTIONS ON HOW TO FILTER THE SIGHTINGS
###  The first step to performing a sighting search is to direct your attention to the filter search table. As shown below"

on the filter search module you have options on which criteria you would like to search by  such as Date, city, state, country and even shape. 
For this example, I will use the date and city and input 01/02/2010 and the city Orange, CA. 
I get the following results:

its pretty easy to navigate! 

## Summary:
### One Drawback is that there should an actually "Filter" or "Search" button for user to press. 

### My recommendations is that I would like the page to interactive witth the users that come across it , I feel like that would be beneficial to both Dana and the audience she is appealing to.
